# Spam-SMS-Pediction
In today's digital age, spam SMS messages pose a significant threat to both individuals and organizations, leading to privacy breaches, fraud, and unwanted communication. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate, helping to protect users from potential risks.

The project begins with the collection of a large dataset of SMS messages, which are labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate). The dataset undergoes extensive pre-processing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and the removal of stop words, to prepare the data for analysis.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to transform the raw text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and word embeddings are applied to capture the semantic meaning of the messages.

Several machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, are explored to build the spam detection model. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and validated on the remaining data to assess its performance.

Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The best-performing model is then fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve its predictive accuracy.

The project also involves creating a confusion matrix and ROC curve to visualize the model's performance and understand its strengths and weaknesses in detecting spam messages.

The final model is designed to be implemented in real-world applications, such as SMS filtering systems and mobile apps, to automatically detect and block spam messages. By reducing the number of spam SMS messages reaching users, this project contributes to a safer and more secure communication environment.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and NLP in combating spam, providing a practical solution to a common and growing problem in the digital world.
